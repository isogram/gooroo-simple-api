The goal of this test is to create a simple RESTful server. You may use any 3rd party libraries and tools that youâ€™d like. 

This Node.js CRUD code use

```

## Database

The application connect to MySQL database using Sequelize. The configuration of database added in `models/index.js`. Configuration located at config directory.
Initialize the configuration and connect to database on `app.js`.

This app use database named `gooroo`. So make sure you are create it before running the app.
